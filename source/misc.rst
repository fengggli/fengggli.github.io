My spare time
------------------

I like hiking, jogging. I have travelled to many great places in China, and I am planning to visit more places in the US!
In my spare time I like playing pingpong or tennis with friends.

TODO
-------

I should probably do some tech blogs..

  I started to learn swimming since 2017 fall, not very good at it but really enjoy it a lot as a way for exercise and relax.
  Recenty I am learning guitar with one friend, we are so both excited about what we can achieve in the year of 2018.
