# Breif
I am Feng Li(李丰), currently a PhD student in IUPUI. I work with my advisor [Dr. Fengguang Song](cs.iupui.edu/~fgsong/)  in areas of Distributed Systems and High Performance Computing. 

# Education
* [2015-~] Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN

  PhD student, Computer and Information Science
* [2011~2015] Huazhong University of Science & Technology

  Bachelor in Computer Science and Technology

# Experience
## IBM Research, Almaden 
**May 2017~ Aug 2017, Research Intern**

Working on persistent memory management on NVMe devices. A "collaborative paging" service is designed for extended memory mode where faults are handled in kernel space while I/O happens in user space. DPDK/SPDK tools are used to enable fast access via user space.

## IUPUI
**Aug 2016 ~ Mar 2017, research project**

Working on s software framework for scientific workflows where RDMA technique is used to couple numerical simulation, data analysis and real-time visualization application together. 

* A highly distributed and optimized anomaly detection method is used to detect vortex and other special patterns from turbulence flows. 
* Paper was accepted by PEARC17.

## IUPUI
**Aug 2015 ~ Apr 2016, research project**

Working on a kernelized sparse self-representation model(KSSR) and a novel Kernelized Fast Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm(K-FISTA), to recover the underlying nonlinear structure among data.

* My work mainly includes the implementation, evaluation of the KSSR model and K-FISTA algorithm.
* The paper was accepted in SDM 2016.

## Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology,  Wuhan, China
**Feb 2015 ~ June 2015, undergraduate thesis**

Working on how to add SSD to Ceph(a distributed file system) as cache to improve its data access performance.

My work mainly includes how to utilize the storage of SSD and design the new data caching algorithm.

## Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology,  Wuhan, China
**Sep 2014 ~ Feb 2015, undergraduate research internship**

* worked as a key member in a collaborative project with Huawei Company, China. Our task is to design metadata management algorithm for MRAM-based file systems. a patent is under process, and my work includes:
* changed the original metadata access pattern, optimized the identification of performance-critical data and page replacement policy. 
* read papers and wrote reviews about how MRAM( or other NVRAM) can be used in different methods to enhance system performance and or reduce energy consumption.
* reviewed related patents searched from USPTO, analyzed recent technology (eg.Page Placement in hybrid PRAM and DRAM Main Memory), then made my suggestion for the project.

# For my spare time
I like hiking, jogging. I have travelled alone to many great places in China, I hope I can do that again in the US!
Recently I am learning swimming, but in very entry level.
